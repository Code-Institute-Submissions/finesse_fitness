# UX
## Strategy Plane
The main target audience for Finesse Fitness:
  * Age 16 - 65 - this age range is ideal to help meet the users lifestyle goals
  * Users interested in their fitness and exercise
  * Users interested in improving their diets
  * Users who lack motivation to diet and exercise and need assistance
  * Users who are concerned with their physical and mental health
  * Users who are interested in purchasing fitness clothing and equipment

The user can purchase individual items on the site which make the site available for anyone who visits it. However, the main business goal is to get the user to stay by setting up a profile, subscribing and availing of the subscription's discount and benefits. This creates a friendly environment for the user to to return to and possibly purchase more products from the shop.

Research
* This is a B2C model, hence the website's use of images and lack of text (apart from the blog).
* There is a massive market for fitness products and well being, which seem to be growing every day.
* People purchasing items online are mostly impulse shopping and not many users like to register for new pages. This is why a subscription model is used to increase the number of returning users.

Features worth doing:

## Surface Plane
* Color scheme
  * The colour scheme for the website was kept quite simple, with three main colors of the site:
  ![Color Palette](readme_docs/FinesseFitnessColor.png)

* Typography
  * This project uses one type of font:
    * Lexend Mega taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Imagery
  * The primary reason for using images is for informative purposes. Images are displayed in item cards to allow users to visually engage with items added by other users and decide if they are interested in the item. The secondary purpose of the images is aesthetic. The images displayed on cards are kept quite large and the same size while not being distorted. This attributes to the clean, organized look of the website. An image is also used as a hero image that takes the full screen to separate the page and not distract the user from the message on the landing page. All images have been taken from [unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/), [Lifestyle Sports](https://www.lifestylesports.com) & [Template Monster](https://www.templatemonster.com/landing-page-template/myfitness-gym-landing-page-template-100562.html)

* Other
  * All buttons have the same design of having a border in one of the primary colors and have a hover effect with background fill.
  * I used Bootstrap 5.0 as the front end framework to help with layout and easy pre-built components such as accordeons
