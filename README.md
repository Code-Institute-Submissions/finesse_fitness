# UX
## Strategy Plane
The main target audience for Finesse Fitness:
  * Age 16 - 65 - this age range is ideal to help meet the users lifestyle goals
  * Users interested in their fitness and exercise
  * Users interested in improving their diets
  * Users who lack motivation to diet and exercise and need assistance
  * Users who are concerned with their physical and mental health
  * Users who are interested in purchasing fitness clothing and equipment

The user can purchase individual items on the site which make the site available for anyone who visits it. However, the main business goal is to get the user to stay by setting up a profile, subscribing and availing of the subscription's discount and benefits. This creates a friendly environment for the user to to return to and possibly purchase more products from the shop.

Research
* This is a B2C model, hence the website's use of images and lack of text (apart from the blog).
* There is a massive market for fitness products and well being, which seem to be growing every day.
* People purchasing items online are mostly impulse shopping and not many users like to register for new pages. This is why a subscription model is used to increase the number of returning users.

Features worth doing:

## Surface Plane
* Color scheme
  * The colour scheme for the website was kept quite simple, with three main colors of the site:
  ![Color Palette](readme_docs/FinesseFitnessColor.png)

* Typography
  * This project uses one type of font:
    * Lexend Mega taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Imagery
  * The primary reason for using images is for informative purposes. Images are displayed in item cards to allow users to visually engage with items added by other users and decide if they are interested in the item. The secondary purpose of the images is aesthetic. The images displayed on cards are kept quite large and the same size while not being distorted. This attributes to the clean, organized look of the website. An image is also used as a hero image that takes the full screen to separate the page and not distract the user from the message on the landing page. All images have been taken from [unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/), [Lifestyle Sports](https://www.lifestylesports.com) & [Template Monster](https://www.templatemonster.com/landing-page-template/myfitness-gym-landing-page-template-100562.html)

* Other
  * All buttons have the same design of having a border in one of the primary colors and have a hover effect with background fill.
  * I used Bootstrap 5.0 as the front end framework to help with layout and easy pre-built components such as accordeons

## Testing
All testing was documented in TESTING.md file
📊 👈 testing.md
## Deployment
#### Local
* Instructions to run the project on your local device using an IDE
  
#### Pre-requisites
* Python 3 - used to write the code and to run the project
* PIP - used to install packages
* Git - used for version control
* Visual Studio Code or any IDE of your choice - used to compile the code.
* Stripe Account

#### Recommended
* A virtual environment of your choice - used to contain all installations and packages and prevents clashing projects that might use the same package but different versions.
  * Python 3 has a built-in virtual environment venv. The commands might differ depending on your Operating System, it is advised to read the docs to ensure accuracy.
#### Steps
1. Go to the project [repository](https://github.com/Richiefinegan11/finesse_fitness)
2. Get the files used by using one of the methods below:
  * Download the files used by clicking the 'Code' button located in the top section of the repository. Then select 'Download ZIP' and unzip the files in the directory of your choice.
  * Clone the repository by running the following command from your IDE
    * 'gh repo clone Richiefinegan11/finesse_fitness'
3. In your IDE, navigate to the project directory where you located downloaded files/cloned the repo
  * 'cd path/to/your/folder
4. Activate your virtual environment. If using Python's venv:
  * 'source .venv/bin/activate'
  * on Windows where .venv is the name you gave previously
5. Install all reqauirements from requirements.txt file
  *  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6. Create a file env.py to store environment variables
7. Add environment variable in the format as shown below:
  * os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
 os.environ.setdefault('DEVELOPMENT', '1')
 os.environ.setdefault('ALLOWED_HOSTS', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
 os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
 os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
 os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET_CH', '<your-variable-goes-here>')
 os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET_SUB', '<your-variable-goes-here>')

where

* SECRET_KEY value is a key of your choice, to ensure appropriate seccurity measures, this can be generated using Django Secret Key Generator
* DEVELOPMENT is set to 1 and is ised in settings.py logic to ensure file is dynamic between local and remote setups
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET value is obtained from the Stripe website in conjunction of using ngrok to host the server
Getting Webhooks API value
* ALLOWED_HOSTS this should be set to your ngrok url

8. Run the application
  * ' python3 manage.py runserver'
9. Website should be available on a link similar to http://127.0.0.1:8000. (check your IDE terminal)
10. Note: python3 and pip3 commands can vary depending on version/machine/IDE you're using. Always check docs if unsure.

### Remote
#### Pre-requisites
 * Set up [Heroku](www.heroku.com) Account and app
 * Create [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and upload static files used in the project

#### Steps

1. In Heroku, go to Resources and search for Heroku Postgres, we will use this as our development database
    * Select 'Hobby Dev - Free' and click to Submit Order Form
2. Comment out the 'SQLite and Postgres databases' section in the settings.py file and uncomment 'Postgres Database' section. Add your DATABASE_URL link obtained from Heroku Config Vars
    *  DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-url-goes-here')
 }section of the repository. Then select 'Download ZIP' and unzip the files in the directory of your choice.
3. Migrate your models to Postgres SQL database
    *  python3 manage.py migrate
4. If you have a JSON file with products displayed on the site, import them now in this order
     * 'python3 manage.py loaddata categories'
     * 'python3 manage.py loaddata products'
5. Create a superuser that will be used to access the admin page as well as to manage the database. Enter username, password, and e-mail as required
     * python3 manage.py createsuperuser
6. In settings.py delete the 'Postgres SQL Database' section (make sure you don't commit your DATABASE_URL link!) and un-comment 'SQLite and Postgres SQL Databases' section - this will allow for use of either of the databases interchangeably
7. Freeze dependencies in a requirements.txt file (if it hasn't been created/updated before)
    * pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
8. Create a Procfile that tells Heroku to create a web dyno and add the following line in it, where the-name-of-your-app is the name of your django project
     * web: gunicorn the-name-of-your-app.wsgi:application
9. Add, commit and push your changes up to GitHub
10. Go to Heroku and add all of the following environmental variables (Settings > Reveal Config Vars)
![Heroku Config Vars](readme_docs/HerokuConfig.png)
11.  In Heroku go to Deploy that's located at the top of the site
![Heroku Config Vars](readme_docs/HerokDeploy1.png)
12. Click on the GitHub option and connect your GitHub account as well as your repo from GitHub (search for the repo name)
![Heroku Config Vars](readme_docs/HerokuGitHub.png)
13.  Click on Enable Automatic Deploys and then Deploy Branch, you should see a successful build here
![Heroku Config Vars](readme_docs/deploy-branch.png)
14. Open your app  
![Heroku Config Vars](readme_docs/open-app.png)
15. You should see static/ folder with your static files in it in you S3 bucket.
16. In your S3 bucket, add media/ folder.
17. If you didn't use JSON filer for product import, now is a good time to navigate to your-ulr/admin/ page and add the Products and Categories in.
18. Your app should be deployed and you should be able to see your added products.
